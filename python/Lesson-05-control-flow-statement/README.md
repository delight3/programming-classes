Lesson 05: Control Flow Statements

Welcome to Lesson 05 of the Python Programming Class.

In this lesson, students will learn how to control the flow of execution
in a Python program using conditional statements and loops.

Control flow statements allow programs to make decisions and repeat actions.

Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:
- Understand what control flow is
- Use conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- Use looping statements (while, for`)
- Control loops using break and continue
- Write decision-based and repetitive programs
